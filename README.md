Short Background
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During my work in construction company, we have a paper card system to report all health and safety (hse) reamrks to perfomred works on consturction site. This cards are given to helath and safety department which place them in excel file to analyze and create grpahs which are then presented in report to investor.
If we take underconsideration how much site observation reports are generated during whole project duration, this method is not optimal and cost hundreads of hours of single health and safety inspector. 

Observing this tedious process made me decide to create a program that would support the hse team and save them time in manually entering hundreds of reports into an Excel file. 

What I use in SafeSite
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Django: Python framework for web applications,
* Matplotlib: a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python,
* SQL: Using Django build in API for database objects,
